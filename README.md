# HerApp
## An app that helps women feel safe.
### According to the World Health Organization, 1 in 3 women have experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime. So it is our responsibility to protect at all costs and in any way. This app is easy to use and can help women signal for help with just the tap of a button. It is linked to emergency contacts and the police and is easy to customize.
### The app is based on SDG 5: Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls.
